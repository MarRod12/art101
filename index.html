		<h1>Margarita Rodriguez</h1>

		<p>Hello my name is Margarita and I am a third year AGPM student. I'm looking forward to this class and I hope to learn a lot. I am sort of familiar with HTML and CSS as I've taken a class in the past but there is always more to learn. :)</p>

		<p>I am 20 years old and grew up in the East Bay. A few interests of mine are going to the beach, listening to music, and playing with my dog! I also like horror movies or any type of true crime/horror show.</p>

      <h2 id="heading2">Problems</h2>
      <p>Some problems I had was figuring out which variables were being changed and which one should be appended to show what I wanted it to. I also had trouble when trying to change the CSS of the headings, I wanted them all to be changed in one piece of code but ended up having to change each heading as it's own element. Another issue I had was trying to append the same element twice to have two new lines but it only printed once, I had to make each line break its own element.</p>

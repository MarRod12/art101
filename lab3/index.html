	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>The purpose of this lab is to practice file structures and create a functional homepage.</p>

	<h3>Difficulties</h3>
	<p>I encountered a few difficulties when putting an image into the right folder on Atom. I was confused when I had it open in Atom and couldn't add the image but I eventually figured out how to add the image into the folder on my device. I also had trouble getting the image and text to meld together in the way I envisioned but after I figured how to use padding and the float property it worked out as I wanted.</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>The results of this lab are shown in the image to the right.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>Some problems we encountered were trying to get the numbers to show up in the HTML file. We had them printing in the console but couldn't get them to print anywhere else. We had a few problems with the combination words printing but once we put the code for them above the rest of the code it worked correctly.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>You are looking at the HTML file I created. Below is the program execution.</p>

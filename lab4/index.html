	<h2>Challenge:</h2>
	<p>The challenge was to create two sets of pseudocode. One detailing how to do an everyday task and the other on a computer task.</p>

	<h2>Problems:</h2>
	<p>Some problems we ran into was understanding some of the JavaScript tags in the author block. The @file and @since tags were confusing and we could not figure out how to use them. Another issue we ran into was making sure we were putting the correct code into the HTML document.</p>

	<h2>Results:</h2>

	<div id="pseudocode">
		<h4 id="indent">How to make breakfast sandwiches.</h4>
		<ol id="indent">
			<li>Toast bread on a pan with butter.</li>
			<li>Place cheese on toasted bread and place hot over cheese.</li>
			<li>Place other preferred ingredients (mushrooms, ham, or spinach).</li>
			<li>Place other bread over the other pieces.</li>
			<li>Cut diagonally and eat!</li>
		</ol>
		<h4 id="indent">Backing up your data with iCloud.</h4>
		<ol id="indent">
			<li>On your computer, open up system preferences.</li>
			<li>Click “time machine”.</li>
			<li>Select “Back up automatically”.</li>
			<li>Select drive to back up automatically</li>
		</ol>

	</div>

	<pre><code>
		//Open your computer
		//Navigate to system preferences.
		//Click “time machine”.
		//Select “Back up automatically”
		//Select drive to back up automatically
	</pre></code>

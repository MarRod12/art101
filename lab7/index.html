  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>Working with my partner, write functions that take user input.</p>

  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>Some problems we ran into was when we were originally making the files for Lab 7 it accidentally created new directories. They contained the same content as the folder but had no real use so we managed to get rid of them with no change to our code. We also had trouble realizing that we had to finish writing the entire JavaScript plus the document.writeln to have the program work. We found that the code we wrote doesn't sort capital letters and were unable to find a way to make it work.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>You are looking at the HTML file I created. Here is the program execution.</p>
